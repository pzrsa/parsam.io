Today I turn 21 years old, which if you didn’t know, is the one after 20. Crazy, I know.

I think 20 was the most formative year for me so far. I’m generally becoming more well rounded in the important aspects of life.

I feel the stakes for my decisions getting higher as I age, and this year was eye-opening for that. I’ve been learning a lot from my mistakes, and am constantly self aware of where I need to be better.

Apparently I could drink alcohol in the US now, but I’m still gonna hold off on drinking until a special occasion with a special someone.

As always, grateful for everything.
