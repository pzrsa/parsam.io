The [2024 Oscar's](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2024) are happening this March, and I thought I'd share my predictions. I'll be doing this for every year, including the Golden Globes and Emmys (which I just missed out on sharing my thoughts with, oh well).

## Best picture

- American Fiction
- Anatomy of a Fall
- Barbie
- The Holdovers
- Killers of the Flower Moon
- Maestro
- **Oppenheimer**
- Past Lives
- Poor Things
- The Zone of Interest

Watched Barbie, Killers of the Flower Moon, Oppenheimer and Past Lives. I think Oppenheimer will win, what it achieved on a technological level was so impressive to witness in the theatre.

## Best original score

- American Fiction
- Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
- Killers of the Flower Moon
- **Oppenheimer**
- Poor Things

Oppenheimer. If you wanna know why, just look at my [last.fm scrobbles](<https://www.last.fm/user/pzrsa/library/music/Ludwig+G%C3%B6ransson/Oppenheimer+(Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack)?date_preset=ALL>).

## Best director

- Anatomy of a Fall - Justine Triet
- Killers of the Flower Moon - Martin Scorsese
- **Oppenheimer - Christopher Nolan**
- Poor Things - Yorgos Lanthimos
- The Zone of Interest - Jonathan Glazer

The goats Scorsese and Nolan going head to head, but I truly think Nolan has set another standard going forward.

## Best actor

- Bradley Cooper - Maestro
- Colman Domingo - Rustin
- Paul Giamatti - The Holdovers
- **Cillian Murphy - Oppenheimer**
- Jeffrey Wright - American Fiction

Only saw Cillian Murphy, and honestly think it's time for the man to win. Also I think the Academy want to join the hype around it, since I guess that's how it works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Best actress

- Annette Bening - Nyad
- **Lily Gladstone - Killers of the Flower Moon**
- Sandra Huller - Anatomy of a Fall
- Carey Mulligan - Maestro
- Emma Stone - Poor Things

Saw Lily Gladstone, and her performance brought me to tears. She gave me that feeling of guilt, even though I had nothing to do with the Osage murders. I also really like Emma Stone, but I've yet to watch Poor Things but I can see a world where she wins. I'm going with Lily for this one.

## Best supporting actress

- **Emily Blunt - Oppenheimer**
- Danielle Brooks - The Color Purple
- America Ferrera - Barbie
- Jodie Foster - Nyad
- **Da'Vine Joy Randolph - The Holdovers**

I liked Emily Blunt (especially in the end scene where Oppenheimer was handed an award, if you've seen the film you know how cold she was in it), but there's a lot of hype around Da'Vine Joy Randolph performance in The Holdovers so idk.

## Best supporting actor

- Sterling K Brown - American Fiction
- **Robert De Niro - Killers of the Flower Moon**
- Robert Downey Jr - Oppenheimer
- Ryan Gosling - Barbie
- Mark Ruffalo - Poor Things

I mean, De Niro was the scariest mf in Killers of the Flower Moon, and he's one of my favourites, but I also found RDJ chilling as Levi Strauss. De Niro for this one.

## Best adapted screenplay

- American Fiction
- Barbie
- **Oppenheimer**
- Poor Things
- The Zone of Interest

I think Oppenheimers pacing for a 3 hour biopic was well done.

## Best original screenplay

- Anatomy of a Fall
- The Holdovers
- Maestro
- May December
- **Past Lives**

Past Lives, great film and score. Definitely brought me to tears, and if you didn't already know, I tend to tear or cry a lot when it comes to films/shows, but rarely anything else. It's really strange.

## Best original song

- The Fire Inside - Flamin' Hot (Diane Warren)
- **I'm Just Ken - Barbie (Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt)**
- It Never Went Away - American Symphony (Jon Batiste, Dan Wilson)
- Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People) - Killers of the Flower Moon (Scott George)
- What Was I Made For? - Barbie (Billie Eilish, Finneas O'Connell)

To be honest, I don't care about this one but I'll just say I'm Just Ken cause Ryan Gosling.

## Best animated feature

- **The Boy and the Heron**
- Elemental
- Nimona
- Robot Dreams
- Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

The Boy and the Heron, haven't even watched it yet but I just have a hunch it's winning. Across the Spider-Verse was so good though, but doesn't feel complete to win.

## Best costume design

- **Barbie**
- Killers of the Flower Moon
- Napoleon
- Oppenheimer
- Poor Things

I liked Barbie, Killers of the Flower Moon or Poor Things. I think Barbie. Heard good things about Napoleon costume design, but that film felt like such a joke to many, so I don't think so.

## Best make-up and hairstyling

- Golda
- Maestro
- Oppenheimer
- **Poor Things**
- Society of the Snow

Poor Things, from the trailer it looks cute.

## Best production design

- **Barbie**
- **Killers of the Flower Moon**
- Napoleon
- **Oppenheimer**
- Poor Things

Barbie's World looked incredible, but I loved the rawness of both Killers of the Flower Moon and Oppenheimer.

## Best sound

- **The Creator**
- Maestro
- Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One
- **Oppenheimer**
- The Zone of Interest

The Creator was a great sci-fi visually and audibly, but man Oppenheimer was soo good so idk.

## Best film editing

- Anatomy of a Fall
- The Holdovers
- **Killers of the Flower Moon**
- **Oppenheimer**
- Poor Things

No idea, no gripes with Killers of the Flower Moon or Oppenheimer.

## Best cinematography

- El Conde
- Killers of the Flower Moon
- Maestro
- **Oppenheimer**
- Poor Things

Oppenheimer for sure.

## Best visual effects

- **The Creator**
- Godzilla Minus One
- Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
- Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One
- Napoleon

The Creator was beautiful. The fact it was all shot on a [Sony FX3](https://nofilmschool.com/greig-fraser-gareth-edwards-sony-fx3) makes it even more impressive. I also loved GOTG3 and MI7 with Tom Cruise famously [jumping off a mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lsFs2615gw).
