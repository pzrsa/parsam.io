title: "My Watch Collection"

I've been into watches and [horology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horology) for almost 3 years now, where it all started during the pandemic with an abundance of time, and an internet to surf. I don't really remember who got me into the hobby exactly, but I think I can safely blame someone on YouTube.

Over the years I’ve built a small collection (with 3 watches I don’t know if you could even call it a collection at this point), and I thought I should share it since a post about my watches is well overdue.

## SEIKO (the OG)

My beloved _SEIKO SNZG13K1_, the one that started it all. I bought this beauty back in September 2020 as my first ever mechanical watch, all for less than £100.

What attracted me to it was its practical design. I also love the small red accent on the second hand, it sort of pops alongside all that black and white.

On the inside, it uses a [7S36C](https://calibercorner.com/seiko-caliber-7s36/) automatic movement, which is a pretty basic movement on paper. Yet, despite its shortcomings (lack of [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_watch) or [hand-winding](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+watch+hand+winding)), I greatly appreciate the engineering gone into building a decently performant movement at a reasonable price.

I've only ever used 3 straps for this watch. The stock bracelet, a black nato strap, a leather strap, and a Spectre Bond Marine Nationale strap (pictured below). It’s just so versatile, it can pretty much go with any style of strap.

Anyways, my SEIKO has always held a special place in my heart, and I'm always grateful for how it's introduced me to this hobby. Every time someone asks me what brands they should look at for their first watch, SEIKO is always on the top of that list.

## G-SHOCK "CasiOak"

This is my daily driver, the _G-SHOCK GA-B2100-1A1ER_. I bought this in May 2022, also for about £100 (thank you student discount). It has by far been my most worn watch, simply because it's a G-SHOCK, and that's enough of a reason.

It also features solar charging, so I never have to worry about it dying (as long as the sun exists), but honestly even if it didn't have solar charging I would have to replace the battery roughly every decade. These things are built to last.

My favourite part of this watch is the design, I think it's pretty unique for a G-SHOCK. The stealthy black and octagon shape is gorgeous. And obviously the watch reminds many of the [Audemars Piguet Royal Oak](https://www.audemarspiguet.com/com/en/collections/royal-oak.html), hence the nickname "CasiOak".

I absolutely love this watch since I think it perfectly pictures my minimalistic style.

## Casio

I thought it would also be worth sharing the latest edition in my collection, the _Casio A168_. I got this for about £30, and I just couldn't see myself going about building a collection without having this in it. It's such a classic, and you can't really go wrong owning a watch like this.

## My Dream Watch

For the longest time my dream watch has been the _[Sinn 556A](https://www.sinn.de/en/Modell/556_A.htm)_. I think it's the finest of German engineering, plus it's something feasible to purchase (€1325.00 / ~£1150.00 / ~$1400.00).

Prior to this, it was the Rolex Explorer 214270. As you can probably tell, there's a certain type of watch I go for: black and white, big numerals, and straight purity. The best way to put them is boringly beautiful.

## Closing thoughts

You probably noticed the recurring theme across all my watches: they're made by Japanese companies.

Honestly though, I have no real conclusion. I just wanted to say I hope you enjoyed the glimpse into one of the hobbies I'm super passionate about. I'll definitely be updating the blog with any new timepieces (one day the Sinn 556A!), so keep an eye out on that by subscribing to my [RSS](https://parsam.io/feed.atom) feed.
