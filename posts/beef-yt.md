title: "My beef with YouTube"

I like to watch a lot of YouTube, and I also like to watch a few great shows, one of them being an absolute masterpiece which is [Succession](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/). I won’t go on a passionate ramble in this post about how much I love this show but let me just say that this show is perfection. The [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRW80bBvVD3W4wa54jT6jFHm5mOEJ1uNf) is [powerful](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ngeaaHOHWmauqaSqbuEdSbIBl_DjvjJb4), dialogue is clever, cinematography is beautiful, characters are unique, and have I mentioned how [amazing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyUGJOhsTISu7CpFXbmR6vrauZNtxdSkq) the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n9iWeOUpsuxZd_S_xnUW4Pc51ZjswgHY4) by [Nicholas Britell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0WzqanwlG0) is? Like how could you listen to the [main theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlgWqcHXD8w) and not feel so sophisticated?

Anyways, as someone who likes to dissect and discuss everything when it comes to films/shows, I like rewatching clips from important scenes on YouTube to catch details I didn't notice on first watch. I also love the discourse behind it in the comments, because I get to learn more about the hidden meanings behind every piece of dialogue, body language, etc.

But oh my God, I wish YouTube would stop showing me spoilers from the show in my recommended and up next. Why on earth does it think it's a good idea to recommend a scene from the finale when I just watched one clip from the first season?

I’ve constantly clicked “Not interested” on the video after I’ve sadly read the title, but it still keeps coming back with the same shit. I couldn't tell you how many shows they’ve ruined because of this. I feel like I'm getting punished for liking something a bit too much.

A brute force solution they could implement would be to add a checkbox marking that the video contains spoilers, just like how Reddit has a spoiler tag for posts. A lot of issues would arise with this though, since they probably wouldn’t want to recommend a video containing spoilers, and so people simply won't enable it. Also a lot of video essays on films/shows contain a few spoilers, would they have to enable it as well? I think this would work for videos where it's the entire scene, and users would actually search for it as opposed to it randomly popping up in their recommendations.

I don't know though, I guess I'll start opening up a YouTube tab in incognito.
