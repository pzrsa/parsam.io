title: "How I went from a video game addicted 17 year old to software engineer at Google and Tesla"
draft: true
---

4 years ago, I started my software engineering career at just 17 years old. And during this time I've already had the rare opportunity to work at two innovative companies: [Google](https://google.com) and [Tesla](https://tesla.com).

You're likely assuming that (rightfully so) I'm some well educated wiz kid to pull this off, but you'd be surprised to learn that I never even went to university. I had terrible grades in school, and my worst grade was ironically in computer science.

With a background like that, no one could've ever predicted I'd end up in the position I am today. I went from a complete bum to... well... less of a bum.

The new year has come to a start, and it marks roughly four years since I started learning to code. I figured it'd be a good time to finally share my unique journey going from a newbie to a mid-level software engineer at Tesla.

I hope I can serve as a form of inspiration, especially for young people looking to get a jump start to their career through an unconventional route. I certainly would've loved to read something like this when I was starting out.

One of my life philosophies is authenticity, and I see a huge lack of it with [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) stories that resort to clickbait tactics to make a quick buck.

Without further ado, I hope you enjoy this glimpse into my journey ü§ù

# Reincarnated

The story begins in July 2020, London. I'd just turned 17 and finished my first out of second year of college doing a [BTEC Level 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTEC_Extended_Diploma) in Information Technology. In the UK, college refers to pre-university, kinda like senior high school I think. My college was a bit rough, I'm pretty sure someone got stabbed there.

For the past 3 to 4 years until then my routine on non-school days was hopping on my gaming PC immediately after waking up and grinding video games non-stop until the AM with the boys.

I was fairly good at most games since I started playing at a young age, but when Fortnite released I took it a lot more competitively, to the point of making a few grand from tournaments. I know, this bit of my journey is quite embarrassing since it's literally a kids game that I loved playing.

But one day all of this started to vanish. To this day I can't pinpoint exactly what caused it, but I know I just got rid of everything cold turkey. I cut off ties with the friends I'd played games with, deleted social media, and in the coming weeks sold all my gaming equipment.

I didn't even care about how much I sold my setup for, I just wanted to get rid of it all. I was just sick and tired of myself and really wanted to make a change. I knew that this was the only route that would work for me.

After selling it all, I obviously didn't have a computer at this point, so I bought some random refurbished Dell computer, the type that you'd use in school.

I went from a setup like this:
![](setup-1.jpg)

To this:
![](setup-2.jpg)

I felt reborn, and while I was going through all of this I had turned into a completely different person, bordering into a robot.

In all honesty though, the next few months were some of the loneliest I've ever experienced. But I finally broke the state of autopilot I was in for most of my life, letting time pass by.

If you're curious, I've not touched video games again. The only exception was when I bought a PS5 after joining Google just to play the [spider-man games](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(video_game_series)>). I ended up returning it immediately after finishing them. It was funny when the guy I was returning it to was a bit surprised since it was still hard to get at that time.

If you'd asked me about my stance on games after I'd just quit, I would've been super against it. But after some time I realised everyone has their own way to destress.

Personally, I enjoy lifting weights by following a program (I follow the Kizen 12 Week Powerlifting Program), logging my workouts (I use [Gravitus](https://gravitus.com/)) and seeing the progress over time. I see it as more of a duty than a hobby, but I'm progressing on my lifts just as someone is progressing their character in a game.

With that said, I think most people who are struggling with finding purpose could start with being more intentional with what they spend their free time on. This obviously isn't just tied to video games, but it's a common trap that boys my age get stuck with.

I still mostly see negatives with playing video games. In general I try to avoid saying stuff like this, since it's such a touchy subject and people don't want to face the truth. Some people make it work, I mean shit look at [my boss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/11/22/elon-musk-apparently-just-became-the-no-1-diablo-4-player-in-the-world/).

Anyways, since I'd carved out the only thing I did in a day, I started using my time to devour a lot of YouTube videos learning how to start a business. I tried to do some Amazon drop-shipping stuff, which I find absolutely hilarious since it feels like such a scammy thing to do.

I did a ton of research, but I didn't spend a single penny on actually buying something from [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/) and selling it. In hindsight though that experience did teach me a lot about communicating, even though I practically did nothing.

# Applying to University

In December 2020, I was in the process of applying to university. I mentioned at the beginning that I had bad grades, which meant that my options were limited to low ranked universities.

At this point I wasn't even considering anything tech related, so I decided to apply to places in the subject of Accounting/Finance as I wanted to be a finance bro. No trust fund, 6'0", brown eyes.

I'll come out and say that it's ridiculous how much you're punished for doing bad in secondary school. You can see how a number on a piece of paper can determine the route you end up on, which directly impacts your career path. Teachers in my college put so much fear in me about this idea as if I'll wind up jobless.

# Learning to Code

Around the same time, I‚Äôd just watched Fincher's masterpiece: [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) (I know, how cliche), and let me just say that it indeed did have an impact on me to start learning to code. The film just made it look so God damn cool.

I started doing some research into learning this thing called coding, so I went through a bunch of different resources on YouTube and whatnot, but I ended up sticking with learning [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). No specific reason as to why, but I guess it was nice having that quick feedback loop of seeing your code visually do something.

After finishing it I got kinda bored with making elements do stuff, so I moved on to learning an actual programming language, Python. I learned it through some Udemy course (even made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAYsqj7_95I) on it). God I looked so young in that video. I barely stuck with that course for a few weeks.

In February 2021 I slowly but surely started building a bunch of random crap using technologies like [Python](https://python.org) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) (a web framework). I generally started to get myself really interested in the web space.

![](2021-contributions.png)

I wrote a script to notify me when the PS5 was back in stock on Amazon by literally using a web scraper and listening for an element change. Sure it‚Äôs the most basic thing you could build, but I just felt so proud of it.

I started to feel a bit limited in what I could do on the web with just Flask/Python/HTML/CSS. Everything felt so vanilla, and lacked the sauce. Naturally I gravitated towards acquiring the final infinity stone for building websites, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). I stumbled upon [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), and I remember this being a pretty solid course to learn JS/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

I thought "this programming stuff is pretty cool, I wonder if I could make a career out of it". After some research, I decided to decline my offers, and applied to study Computer Science at another low-ranked university. They also provided me with an offer, so I was finally set on starting my studies later that year in September.

# Building my Website

As you could imagine, I never read books (with the only exception of course being the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series). The first "real" book I ever read was "[Think and Grow Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_and_Grow_Rich)".

It was gifted to me by one of my dad's friends, and he was preaching to me about how much it changed his life, so 17 year old me was like "eh I'll read it I guess". Looking back on it, this book contained a lot of [snake oil BS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil), but honestly it was the best thing I could've read at the time.

It got me interested to start reading more books, to which I stumbled upon someone who I'd say has changed my life, and that man is [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/).

I read his book, ‚Äú[Anything You Want](https://sive.rs/a)‚Äù after seeing it in an [Ali Abdaal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1gOEY3cs4&t=376s), and loved it. It had a bunch of lessons to learn from for both life and business.

I checked out Derek's website, emailed him a novel about my whole life story, not expecting him to respond. I surprisingly got a response, and after a few back and forths, I mentioned to him that I built a website using Webflow, costing me $16 a month.

![](derek-email.png)

He proceeded to tell me to give me a step by step guide on building a website from scratch, using pure HTML/CSS. I was mind blown, I immediately switched over to hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and thus the inception of my new open source website was [born](https://github.com/pzrsa/parsam.io/commit/7927cccdda9843bdc7c4b17ff80626516d628301).

I love another thing he told me:

> "But for making a new site? Don't let anyone sell you on some complex solution. They're saying you need a jumbo jet when really you need a bicycle.¬†Do your HTML by hand like this, and then you'll know when your site has become so big that you need a little more automation to help manage changes or links to the hundreds of pages inside.¬†But until then, no no no. Just do HTML by hand."

The first ever [book note](https://parsam.io/anything-you-want) I wrote was on "Anything You Want".

# Interviewing with Google

Now that I was on track to study computer science, I started taking a deeper look at the job opportunities. I'd already learned about FAANG, so as any aspiring CS student does, I took a look around at the big tech companies, hoping I'd one day join them.

I'd also spent too much time polishing my resume, so I figured it would be a good time to apply to some places and get a bit of work experience before university.

So on the Google careers page, I stumbled upon an opportunity that would change the course of my life. It was an early career software engineering position, and I just applied to it without thinking much.

I got a response in 4 days.

A fire suddenly lit up under me, so I immediately started grinding [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), reading [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and reaching out to strangers on the internet to give me mock interviews. I remember having to do a mock interview at 6am, barely awake, with an engineering manager from [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/) based in the US.

These were some of the most nerve racking yet exciting times. I took every interaction as a learning experience, and removed myself from the outcome completely.

Keep in mind that while I was doing these interviews, I was still on track for university in September. I went to the open day and spoke with the existing students to get a grasp of the course. I wasn't feeling it at all, but I had no other choice really. I really had to make this Google position work.

What makes it worse is that a deadline was set for students to finalise their accommodation/dorm before the term started. I held off on it until my interviews concluded.

Suddenly I had 2 days left to complete it, but then I get a call from my recruiter. I got the job offer.

After a lot of thinking, I deferred my university date to next year and accepted the once in a lifetime offer to join Google.

# Working at Google

![](welcome-google.jpeg)

I started at Google in September 2021, and went through the usual onboarding stuff. I met my first ever manager and joined the [Play Console](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console) team.

Our team was part of an organisation who owned the core services on the platform, with our team being responsible for the messages feature. We would send messages to developers on the platform, informing them about changes they should make to their app. We owned the messaging pipeline for that.

My mentor, who worked at the company for 20+ years, was an absolute legend so I learned so much from him. Everyone else in my team gave me the necessary mentoring to do things at Google scale. There was also so much tooling involved that it takes months just to feel comfortable. They say 6 months is the time it usually takes before you actually get into the rhythm.

Also, you can ask any current or former Google engineer, they can't deny the fact that the developer experience they've built is incredible. From code searching, editing, reviewing, deploying, etc. Everything is engineered in-house, and it just works somehow. Felt like magic to me.

During my time in Play Console team I worked on some interesting stuff, like making improvements to the pipeline using [Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>), and building a tool in [Go](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)>) to speed up tedious processes. The tool was a [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), and it saved hours of engineering time each month. I even got recognition for it from a senior engineer which I found really cool.

My learning at this rate was compounding exponentially, I was learning how to build real software for millions.

However, after about 9 months on the team, I had a discussion to switch teams after I saw an opportunity that I just had to take: to join the Web on Android team. This team had me split across 2 orgs, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Android](https://www.android.com/).

I was super excited to work on two of the biggest open source projects in the world.

I worked on a feature called [WebAPKs](https://web.dev/articles/webapks), which enabled users to install web apps as a native Android app. I mostly wrote Go, but towards the end of my tenure I started writing some C++ which was also challenging but pushed me.

Our server was handling tens of millions of monthly requests, and working on this team also got me super interested in learning more about scalable backend architectures.

I learned so much from my time at Google. I worked with some of the smartest people, and I felt so grateful being the dumbest in the room.

Even got a photo with [Sundar Pichai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai).

# In search for the next opportunity

Everything was honestly great. Free food/gym, smart people, interesting problems, so I couldn't really complain much. With that said however, I had to start looking for my next opportunity.

My main motivation for a new opportunity was that I wanted to change everything up while I can at a young age. Not only does moving to a new company bring new challenges, but moving to a new city would allow me to grow as a person like no other way. I'd learn to live alone, cook for myself, and just overall be a man. I'm grateful that I can live with my parents, but it was time I started living by myself at 20.

I was back to grinding Leetcode and reaching out to the kind people I've met over the past 2 years who were willing to support me. I hit the ground running and started interviewing with places like [Meta](https://meta.com/), [Spotify](https://spotify.com/), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), [XTX Markets](https://www.xtxmarkets.com/), [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), etc.

However, an opportunity popped up which had the perfect combination of everything I wanted in my next chapter: Tesla. My friend [Cyrus](https://x.com/cyrusyari) kindly referred me to them, and I'm forever grateful for him.

Tesla was perfect for this as I would move to Berlin, which is not far from London. Although it is Germany, Berlin is fine since I don't need to speak the German language in most cases. I started learning German about a month ago now.

I went through a few interview rounds with the team, then my recruiter called me to share the fantastic news: an offer to join Tesla.

Funnily enough I was also interviewing with another Elon company, [X](https://x.com). At this point I'd already received the Tesla offer so I didn't proceed with the other rounds, but it was still a great learning experience.

# Working at Tesla

I've been at Tesla since April 2024, and it has been one hell of a ride so far.

I don't even know where to begin, but I can start by saying that it was definitely tough after the first few months. At that point the excitement had worn off, so I felt a lot of pressure suddenly weighing on me that I didn't expect.

But now I feel like I have a good routine going on, which is what I at least wanted after I had finished probation.

My team (I'm sure at least one of you is going to read this post) is lovely, I feel like we get along with each other really well.

While on this topic, one thing I've learned about teams is that you could have the best product in the world, but if the people in your team don't enjoy working together then what's the point? I'm glad I realised early on what a good team looks like because in all my cases I've gotten along so well with them.

There's probably a difference between a team who get along at work and a team who you can also go out to enjoy with.

One thing I find unique about Tesla is that despite it being worth over a trillion, it still operates like a startup. I wanted to work in a smaller environment, but I still appreciate not having to deal with a startup going belly up.

# Reflection

If you give someone the opportunity to lock in for a whole year, no outside contact, to change up their habits and entire behaviour, do you think they'd do it? I think under the right circumstances they will, especially if the change is drastic enough.

Ever since I made this change I've been on a constant cycle of change.

Most interactions and decisions I make somehow makes me want to improve, no matter what it is.

Everyone does this to some extent, but I often feel like it can be damaging since I never feel stable. I don't hear people speak about this, so I certainly hope I'm not alone.

It's also worth mentioning that if you get into the game early, you're going to always feel like the youngest. Still to this day, I've not worked with someone who was younger than me. It rapidly matures you, and the people you're going to hang out with will be much older than you.

It doesn't sound like much, but it does affect you to some extent. You can never feel connected to the people your age who are in completely different life circumstances. Don't get me wrong I'm extremely lucky and grateful for this position, but I get this feeling that I somehow fast tracked my way, and I can't afford to stop.

Luck played a heavy role in my journey, but it's because I set myself up in situations to improve the chances of it. When you do so many things, serendipity does its job.

It goes without saying I'm humbled and grateful for everyone I've come across through this wild journey. I couldn't have made it this far without some people sharing their time with me.

This is still just the beginning, I have a long way ahead of me.

Shoutout to [Taimur](https://x.com/taimurabdaal) for giving me the idea to write this post.

I also want to take the time to say thank you so much for reading this far. It means the world to me, and I hope it was of some value to you.
