Today, I turn 22 years old. Wednesday is also the day I was born.

Every year I slowly get closer and closer to the age people always guess for me (usually off by 3 years), which is insane because I don't even think I look that old. Some people even thought I was almost 30! My Persian genetics in the western world probably plays a part.

Anyways, I'm quite optimistic for this segment of my life. I know I always say that, since every year since 17 has been nothing but growth, but it's true. I'm starting to see the compound effects of my decisions flourish.

In [last years post](https://parsam.io/21) I said I was gonna hold off on drinking ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì "until a special occasion with a special someone", but honestly having my first pint with my dad brought me joy more than anything else.

This year I tried a shit ton of new stuff, and I've broken the seal on keeping streaks for the sake of it. I'm not special. It's fine to do things I was previously against without a solid ground to defend. I need to have skin in the game for the opinions I hold.

I'm definitely someone who thinks too much about stuff, but I'm starting to learn it's good to take a step back and smell the roses. Ignorance truly is bliss.
