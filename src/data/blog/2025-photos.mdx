I do these yearly, see [2024](https://parsam.io/2024-photos) and [2023](https://parsam.io/2023-photos). 

I think I'm starting to get the hang of my Fuji XT-20 camera with the 35mm lens.

# February

# April

## Rimini, Italy

I went to Rimini with my friends to help with the ultimate frisbee tournament [Paganello](https://www.paganello.com/). I had an incredible time with the Italians. somehow I looked like a bunch of them there.

also tried wine for the first time. I was pouring some during the tournament's opening party:

no joke I almost had a stroke after eating this. gotta be at least 4k calories:

[Ponte di Tiberio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_di_Tiberio_(Rimini))

my friend shared a cool legend about this bridge. the roman emperor Tiberius made a deal with the devil where the devil would build the bridge only on the account that he could claim the first soul who crosses it. Tiberius agreed, but he attempted to cheat the devil by sending like a dog or sheep over the bridge. the devil was furious, so he tried to destroy what he just built, but he built it so well it never broke. there's a [wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_di_Tiberio_(Rimini)#Devil_legend) that does it more justice.

## San Marino

also had the chance to check out this tiny country, technically it existed before Italy unified

# September

was prepping for a powerlifting meet at my gym, my diet and training was dialed tf in

## benched 130kg

technically not a valid lift under [IPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Powerlifting_Federation) rules (need to pause the bar), but still pretty happy with it

<video controls>
 <source src="/blog/130kg-bench.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

## learned there's no press command in the squat

in the competition, a judge is there to tell you commands on your lift. for example, on the bench there are 3: down, press, rack. if you miss a command, you fail the lift. here I was practising those commands until my friend/coach told me there's no press one on the squat lmao
