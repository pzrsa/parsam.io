Boredom is one of the most important states you should get comfortable with.

In the common case of standing in a queue, most people just feel the need to pull out their phone and start filling their brain up with junk.

So, next time you're faced with it, learn to embrace it. Don't just reflexively pull out your phone the second you feel the boredom creeping. Observe what's going on around you, life is beautiful.

I'm sure you're not gonna be on your deathbed saying "I wish watched more short videos", you'll probably say "I wish I took more time to appreciate what was around me".

Intentional periods of boredom helps with lowering your dopamine threshold, so things like studying becomes easier. Most of the things you know you need to get done in life go hand in hand with being bored.

I feel like everyone knows this already in their heart, they know it's true, yet just need someone to remind them of it every now and then to come to that conclusion.
