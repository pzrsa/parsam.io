Iâ€™ve been inspired by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/) to share my own form of [joy and curiosity](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/t/joy-and-curiosity).

- [Read to Forget](https://mo42.bearblog.dev/read-to-forget/) - I read a lot, and always find myself sometimes shuffling around to remember the details. But I like this frame of thinking, and it reminds me of how I've been reading [Taleb's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) books by letting the thoughts marinade in my head over a long period instead of highlighting everything.
- [iPhone dumbphone](https://stopa.io/post/297) - one of my favourite blogs, writing a post on something I love: people trying to make their phone use more intentional.
- [bleu de chauffe](https://www.bleu-de-chauffe.com/en/) - some beautiful bags and accessories made in France.
- [Fonts in use](https://fontsinuse.com/) - I searched up a font and stumbled on this, nice mood board.
- [Do the simplest thing that could possibly work](https://www.seangoedecke.com/the-simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work/) - I try to think this way when building systems, but it's actually much harder in practice.
- [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin) - creating a declarative OS intrigues me, because I like having all aspects of it expressed in clear text. Kinda like how I prefer having an `init.lua` (my Neovim [config](https://github.com/pzrsa/dotfiles/blob/main/nvim/init.lua)) that could be reproduced on other machines.
- [You're a Slow Thinker. Now what?](https://chillphysicsenjoyer.substack.com/p/youre-a-slow-thinker-now-what) - I think I'm a mix of both a fast and slow thinker. I think fast in social interactions, but I struggle with quick mathematics on the spot.

hope you enjoyed! do share anything you've stumbled on recently.
