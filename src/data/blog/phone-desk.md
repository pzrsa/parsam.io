title: "Leaving my phone on my desk overnight"
---

A habit I've stuck with for a couple years is where I leave my phone on my desk overnight.

Pretty much the main reason I started doing this is because I had to get out of bed when my alarm went off. So, it meant I was less likely to jump back into bed, which happened far too often since my phone was arms length away when I was comfortably in bed.

So yeah, that's the main benefit from doing this I guess, and I suggest you give it a go one night.

It's nothing groundbreaking, but you'd be surprised with how many people sleep right next to their phone and think it's ok.
