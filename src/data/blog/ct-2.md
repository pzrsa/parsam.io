welcome to the second edition of cool things. you can check out the [first edition](https://parsam.io/ct-1) if you missed that one.

- [My Approach to Building Large Technical Projects - Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects) - big fan of Mitchell's work on [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/), and I found this post to be a good reminder that perfection can be the enemy of progress. Getting the demo out is more important than anything else to validate an idea.
- [David Lynch's LA house](https://www.wallpaper.com/design-interiors/david-lynch-house-los-angeles-for-sale) - David Lynch's aesthetic is absolutely beautiful and one of a kind.

- [Berkeley Mono Typeface](https://usgraphics.com/products/berkeley-mono) - I recently started using this and man, I've never been this excited over a font before (probably a bit sad).
- [Crust Mill](https://crustmill.com/) - $199 Salt/Pepper grinder. like if [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/) got into kitchenware.
- I often get Spotify links from friends when I'm on my desktop, but for some reason if you're not logged in on open.spotify.com it doesn't want to open the desktop app. to get around this, you can use the [Spotify URI](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids) to force open it. For example:
	- For users: [spotify:user:e4ebkdi70a4wu03jwbwrglzhk](spotify:user:e4ebkdi70a4wu03jwbwrglzhk)
	- For albums: [spotify:album:4m2880jivSbbyEGAKfITCa](spotify:album:4m2880jivSbbyEGAKfITCa)
	- Sames goes for tracks/artists
