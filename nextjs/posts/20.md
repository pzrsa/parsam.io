Turned 20 years old today, it's quite scary how quickly time is passing by now.

I think up until now I was able to get away with a lot things given my age, so now I need to start acting like an actual adult.

Also, I want to make it a yearly thing to write a short post on my birthday just sharing some thoughts.

So grateful for the people I met from 19-20, look forward to 20-21!
